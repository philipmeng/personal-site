## Overview

This project was created as my final project for **CSC402: Web Development**, taught by **Mr. Nick Zufelt** at Phillips Academy.

The site functions as a digital resume that I can use as supplementary material when applying to internships and schools. Its design is inspired by minimalist portfolios created by former PA students, including:

- https://www.davinjeong.com/  
- https://laerdon.github.io/

The site highlights:

- Projects and technical work  
- Activities and leadership roles  
- Other notable experiences  

At the end of the page, there is a photo grid of memories and moments that are personally meaningful to me. I hope you enjoy exploring it!
